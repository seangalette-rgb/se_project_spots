# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. From desktop to a mobile phone the screen will adjust when we change what device we are using to view it.

We used Figma to export images directly from their and we followed the projects instructions in order to match what we have here.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
