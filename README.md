# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. From desktop to a mobile phone the screen will adjust when we change what device we are using to view it.

We used Figma to export images directly from their and we followed the projects instructions in order to match what we have here.
